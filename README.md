****ðŸš¦ UK Road Traffic Incidents Report â€“ Mid-Year 2024****

This project analyzes provisional mid-year 2024 UK road collision data to identify patterns in 30mph roads such as severity and location. The insights aim to support road safety by identifying causes and  possible hotspots.

**ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview**

Source: Department for Transport (DfT) â€“ Road Safety Data

Coverage: Great Britain

Period: January 1 â€“ June 30, 2024

Status: Provisional and unvalidated

Data Format: CSV


**ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examine temporal and spatial trends in road collisions.

Hotspot Identification: Locate areas with high frequencies of severe incidents.


**Tools & Technologies**

Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebooks

Version Control: Git

**Key Findings**

High volumes incidents on 30mph roads compared to other roads.
Severity of incidents on 30mph were slight
These incidents happened in good light and weather conditions.
Incidents were prevalent in single carriageway
Single carriageway junctions were prone to incidents in particular T and staggered junctions

**ðŸ”® Future Work**

Extended Analysis: Include additional factors such as vehicle types and driver demographics.

Dashboard Development: Create an interactive dashboard for real-time data exploration.
